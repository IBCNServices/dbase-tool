This tool is created as part of the [iMinds](http://www.iminds.be/) [D-BASE](http://www.iminds.be/nl/projecten/d-base) [ICON](https://www.iminds.be/en/succeed-with-digital-research/co-operative-research/icon-research-program) project. The D-BASE (Decentralized support for Business Processes in Application Services) project's intentions are:
_Enabling distributed business process outsourcing (BPO) in an interoperable, scalable and secure way_.

The D-BASE tool is a BPMN design tool created by **iMinds-IBCN-UGent** that targets two key focus points of the project:
 * Monitoring of business processes, across the borders of a process;
 * Validating distributed business processes.
